# Forked Repository for Personal Use

This repository is a personal fork of the original [AI Resume Builder repository](https://github.com/TechWithEmmaYT/AI-Resumes-Builder). I have modified the code for my personal learning and portfolio purposes, focusing on local resume creation and enhanced AI features.

Please note that the original **[Techwithemma License Terms](TECHWITHEMMA-LICENSE.md)** still apply to this code. This fork is not for commercial use or redistribution.

## Modifications in This Fork

This version includes several changes to enhance local usability and AI capabilities for personal resume building:

* **Local-First Approach:** Modified the project to primarily support local resume creation and management for personal use, removing dependencies like Kinde authentication.
* **Expanded AI Model Support:** Added a model selector to utilize Gemini 2.0 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, in addition to the original Gemini 1.5 Flash.
* **Control over AI-Generated Lists:** For sections like "Professional Experience" generated by AI, added options (Bullets Count, Chars/Line Count) to control the length and detail level of the generated lists.
* **Duplicate Resume Functionality:** Introduced a button to easily duplicate existing resumes.
* **Improved AI Context Awareness:** The AI model now considers existing resume data (experience, skills, etc.) when generating new content, providing more personalized suggestions.
* **Enhanced Personal Information:** Added optional fields for Github and Linkedin profiles.
* **Flexible Summary Generation:** The AI summary generation now includes options for selecting size (Short, Large, Extra Large) and outputs styled HTML using tags like `<strong>` for improved readability.
* **Professional Experience Enhancements:** Added an option to mark the End Date as "Present" and a "Do not show dates" option. The standard textarea for the summary has been replaced with a RichText editor.
* **Data Reordering:** Implemented reorder functionality with arrow buttons for rearranging entries in sections like Professional Experience, Skills, and the new Projects section.
* **Optional Projects Section:** Added a new, optional "Projects" page to showcase your projects. The title of this section is customizable (e.g., "Portfolio"). This section supports RichText and includes optional fields for Project Name, Project URL, and Git Repository.

## Local Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

To run this application locally with a database, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a local PostgreSQL database installed and running. You can download it from [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2. Make sure the path to your PostgreSQL `bin` directory is added to your system's environment variables (`PATH`). For Windows, this is typically `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin`. Open a new terminal and run `psql --version` to verify.
3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`. Update the database connection details in the `POSTGRES_URL` variable if they differ from your setup.
4. Run the command `npm run db:init` in your terminal. Enter your PostgreSQL password when prompted. This will create the `ai-resumes-builder` database.
5. Run the command `npm run db:push`. Select "Yes, I want to execute all statements." when prompted to apply the database schema.
6. Install project dependencies with `npm install`.
7. To start the application in development mode, run `npm run dev`. For a production build, run `npm run build` followed by `npm run start`.

You should now be able to use the application locally.
