# Forked Repository for Personal Use

This repository is a personal fork of the original [AI Resume Builder repository](https://github.com/TechWithEmmaYT/AI-Resumes-Builder). I have modified the code for my personal learning and portfolio purposes, focusing on local resume creation and enhanced AI features.

Please note that the original **[Techwithemma License Terms](TECHWITHEMMA-LICENSE.md)** still apply to this code. This fork is not for commercial use or redistribution.

## Modifications in This Fork

This version includes several changes to enhance local usability and AI capabilities for personal resume building:

- **Local-First Approach:** Modified the project to primarily support local resume creation and management for personal use, removing dependencies like Kinde authentication.
- **Expanded AI Model Support:** Added a model selector to utilize Gemini 2.0 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, in addition to the original Gemini 1.5 Flash.
- **Control over AI-Generated Lists:** For sections like "Professional Experience" generated by AI, added options (Bullets Count, Chars/Line Count) to control the length and detail level of the generated lists.
- **Duplicate Resume Functionality:** Introduced a button to easily duplicate existing resumes.
- **Improved AI Context Awareness:** The AI model now considers existing resume data (experience, skills, etc.) when generating new content, providing more personalized suggestions.
- **Enhanced Personal Information:** Added optional fields for Github and Linkedin profiles.
- **Personal Information Display Customization:** Implemented options to customize how personal information is displayed on the resume, providing flexibility in presentation format.
- **Flexible Summary Generation:** The AI summary generation now includes options for selecting size (Short, Large, Extra Large) and outputs styled HTML using tags like `<strong>` for improved readability.
- **Professional Experience Enhancements:** Added an option to mark the End Date as "Present" and a "Do not show dates" option. The standard textarea for the summary has been replaced with a RichText editor.
- **Data Reordering:** Implemented reorder functionality with arrow buttons for rearranging entries in sections like Professional Experience, Skills, and the new Projects section.
- **Resume Sections Reordering:** Added the ability to reorder entire resume sections (Personal Info, Summary, Experience, Education, Projects, Skills) with intuitive click-to-select and arrow controls, allowing complete customization of resume layout and flow.
- **Optional Projects Section:** Added a new, optional "Projects" page to showcase your projects. The title of this section is customizable (e.g., "Portfolio"). This section supports RichText and includes optional fields for Project Name, Project URL, and Git Repository.

## Local Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

You can run the database either locally or using Docker.

### Option 1: Run PostgreSQL via Docker

1. Copy .env.example to .env and set the variables:

```shell
POSTGRES_DB=ai_resumes_builder
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

2.Start the database with:

```shell
npm run db:run
```

3.After the database is running, apply migrations:

```shell
npm run db:push
```

### Option 2: Run PostgreSQL Locally

1. Install PostgreSQL locally. Add the bin path to your PATH. Check with `psql --version`.
2. Copy .env.example to .env and set your connection parameters.
3. Initialize the database:

```shell
npm run db:init
```

4. Apply migrations:

```shell
npm run db:push
```

6. Install project dependencies with `npm install`.
7. To start the application in development mode, run `npm run dev`. For a production build, run `npm run build` followed by `npm run start`.

You should now be able to use the application locally.

## Database Backup & Restore

Cross-platform commands for creating backups and restoring PostgreSQL database using Makefile.
Supports Windows (.bat), Linux, and macOS (.sh scripts).

### Create Backup
```bash
make db-backup
```
Creates backup file with format: `dumps/backup_dd_mm_yy_hh_mm.sql`

### Restore from Backup
```bash
make db-restore
```
Interactive process shows available files and asks for confirmation.

### List Available Backups
```bash
make db-list-dumps
```

### Help
```bash
make help
```
Shows available commands and detected operating system.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Restore completely overwrites current database data! Always create backup before restoring.

**Note**: The Makefile automatically detects your operating system:
- **Windows**: Uses `.bat` scripts
- **Linux/WSL**: Uses `.sh` scripts  
- **macOS**: Uses `.sh` scripts

**Alternative**: For direct script execution with pause prompts, use:
- `scripts\backup-interactive.bat` (Windows only)

To deploy this project to Vercel, follow these steps:

### 1. Add Environment Variables

After deploying, navigate to **Vercel > Project Settings > Environment Variables** and add the necessary environment variables for production.

Replace all occurrences of `localhost` with your Vercel domain URL, as shown below:

```plaintext
KINDE_SITE_URL=https://cvbuild-ai.vercel.app/
KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=https://cvbuild-ai.vercel.app/
KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=https://cvbuild-ai.vercel.app/dashboard

```

These variables ensure that the app functions properly on your Vercel deployment.

### 2. Initialize and Deploy

Run the following command to initialize the deployment:

```bash
vercel
```

This command will prompt you to configure the project for the first time if it hasn't been linked to Vercel.

Once configured, deploy the project to production using:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

This will push your latest changes live on Vercel.
